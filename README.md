# Jamf Silent macOS Upgrade Scheduler

A silent macOS upgrade orchestration wrapper for [Graham Pugh's erase-install](https://github.com/grahampugh/erase-install),  
designed for enterprise environments using Jamf Pro or other MDMs.

This script silently pre-caches macOS installers and prompts users only at the final decision point, balancing user flexibility with enforced upgrade deadlines.  
Now with **automatic dependency installation**, **test mode features**, **pre-authentication notice**, **snooze functionality**, **login-time installation**, **emergency abort functionality**, and **comprehensive diagnostics**.

## Jamf Deployment Model

To provide a smooth upgrade experience with minimal disruption, this tool is designed to work with **three separate Jamf policies**:

### 1. Deploy Wrapper Script to Persistent Location (Required First)

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** The wrapper script **must be deployed to a persistent location** on each Mac for deferrals, scheduling, and abort functionality to work properly.

**Why this is required:**
- When users defer installation, the script creates a LaunchDaemon to run 24 hours later
- When users schedule for a specific time, a LaunchDaemon is created for that time
- These LaunchDaemons need to call the script from a persistent disk location
- If the script only exists in Jamf policy memory, deferrals and scheduling will fail

**Jamf Policy: Deploy Wrapper Script**

Create a policy with the following script to deploy the wrapper to a persistent location:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Jamf Policy: Deploy Wrapper Script

echo "Deploying macOS upgrade wrapper script..."

# Create directory
mkdir -p /Library/Management/erase-install

# Download directly from GitHub (always gets latest version)
curl -L -o /Library/Management/erase-install/erase-install-defer-wrapper.sh \
  "https://github.com/MacJediWizard/Jamf-Silent-macOS-Upgrade-Scheduler/releases/download/v1.7.2/erase-install-defer-wrapper.sh"

# Make executable
chmod +x /Library/Management/erase-install/erase-install-defer-wrapper.sh

# Verify deployment
if [ -x "/Library/Management/erase-install/erase-install-defer-wrapper.sh" ]; then
  echo "✅ Script deployed successfully to: /Library/Management/erase-install/erase-install-defer-wrapper.sh"
  ls -lh /Library/Management/erase-install/erase-install-defer-wrapper.sh
else
  echo "❌ ERROR: Script deployment failed"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Jamf Policy Configuration:**

```
General:
  Display Name: Deploy macOS Upgrade Wrapper Script
  Trigger: Enrollment Complete, Recurring Check-in, or Custom
  Execution Frequency: Once per computer

Scripts:
  Priority: Before
  Script: [Upload the deployment script above]

Scope:
  Targets: All computers or specific smart groups
```

**How the script auto-detects its location:**
- The wrapper automatically detects where it's located on disk (lines 356-369)
- It stores this path and uses it when creating LaunchDaemons
- Works regardless of where you deploy it (recommended: `/Library/Management/erase-install/`)

---

### 2. Installer Caching Policy

Run this policy ahead of time to silently download and cache the macOS installer. This ensures that the upgrade can begin immediately when triggered later by the wrapper, without the delay of downloading.

**Jamf policy script:**

```bash
sudo /Library/Management/erase-install/erase-install.sh \
  --download \
  --os 15 \
  --no-fs \
  --check-power \
  --min-drive-space 50 \
  --overwrite \
  --silent
```

**Note:** The `--os 15` parameter is critical to ensure you're downloading the correct macOS version. Without it, erase-install will default to the latest available version.

This policy should be scheduled to run during business hours or off-peak times, ensuring that the installer is already cached locally when needed.

---

### 3. Wrapper Execution Policy

The third policy executes the wrapper script from its persistent location. It handles:

- Prompting the user via SwiftDialog
- Displaying pre-authentication notice for standard users
- Tracking deferrals and enforcing upgrade deadlines
- Managing emergency abort functionality for scheduled installations
- Scheduling installations for later in the day or next login
- Initiating immediate upgrades if required

**Jamf Policy: Execute Wrapper Script**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Execute the deployed wrapper script

/Library/Management/erase-install/erase-install-defer-wrapper.sh
```

**Jamf Policy Configuration:**

```
General:
  Display Name: macOS Upgrade - Start Process
  Trigger: Self Service, Custom, or Recurring Check-in
  Execution Frequency: Ongoing

Scripts:
  Script: [Upload the execution script above]

Scope:
  Targets: Computers that need upgrading
  Exclusions: Smart Group "macOS Upgrade Script Currently Running" (see duplicate prevention section)
```

**How it works:**
- Script executes from persistent location (`/Library/Management/erase-install/`)
- Creates LaunchDaemons that reference the same persistent path
- LaunchDaemons can trigger the script for deferrals/scheduling without Jamf connectivity
- Script remains available offline for local execution

---

## Preventing Duplicate Policy Executions

The wrapper script includes built-in locking mechanisms to prevent simultaneous executions. However, when deployed as a Jamf policy, additional safeguards are recommended to prevent Jamf from triggering the policy multiple times while it's still running (in "Pending" state).

### Smart Group Exclusion with Extension Attribute

This Jamf-native solution automatically excludes computers from the policy scope while the script is running, without requiring any modifications to the wrapper script.

**Step 1: Create Extension Attribute**

Create a new Extension Attribute in Jamf Pro:

```
Display Name: macOS Upgrade Script Status
Description: Detects if the upgrade wrapper is currently running
Data Type: String
Input Type: Script
```

**Extension Attribute Script:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check if upgrade wrapper is currently running

if [ -f "/tmp/erase-install-wrapper-main.lock" ] || \
   [ -f "/var/run/erase-install-wrapper.lock" ]; then
    echo "<result>Running</result>"
    exit 0
fi

if pgrep -f "erase-install-defer-wrapper.sh" > /dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "<result>Running</result>"
    exit 0
fi

if launchctl list | grep -q "com.macjediwizard.eraseinstall.schedule"; then
    echo "<result>Running</result>"
    exit 0
fi

echo "<result>Not Running</result>"
```

**Step 2: Create Smart Group**

```
Name: macOS Upgrade Script Currently Running
Criteria:
  - macOS Upgrade Script Status | is | Running
```

**Step 3: Add Exclusion to Your Wrapper Policy**

```
Policy → Scope Tab:
  Targets: [Your deployment group]
  Exclusions:
    - Smart Group: "macOS Upgrade Script Currently Running"
```

**Step 4: Enable Inventory Updates**

In your wrapper policy:

```
Maintenance Tab:
  [x] Update Inventory
```

**How it works:**
- Policy starts → Script creates lock file
- Inventory update → Extension Attribute detects "Running"
- Smart Group includes computer → Policy automatically excludes it
- Script completes → Next inventory update shows "Not Running"
- Smart Group removes computer → Policy can run again

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No script modifications required
- ✅ Fully Jamf-native solution
- ✅ Works with any trigger type (check-in, login, custom, Self Service)
- ✅ Automatic detection and exclusion
- ✅ Compatible with all wrapper features (deferrals, scheduling, abort)

## Emergency Abort Functionality

Version 1.7.0 introduces comprehensive emergency abort functionality for scheduled installations:

- **Abort Button**: Configurable "Abort (Emergency)" button appears in scheduled installation dialogs
- **Abort Limits**: Users can abort up to 3 times before reaching force install mode
- **Automatic Rescheduling**: After abort, installation is automatically rescheduled with configurable delay
- **Abort Enforcement**: After 3 aborts, scheduled dialogs show no abort button (force install mode)
- **Counter Reset**: Abort counts reset to 0 after successful installation completion
- **Independent Tracking**: Abort counts are separate from deferral counts for flexible policy enforcement

---

## Pre-Authentication Notice Feature

To improve user experience in environments where users operate with standard accounts but need temporary admin privileges for installation, version 1.7.0 includes a pre-authentication notice:

- **User Notification**: Displays a dialog informing users they'll need admin credentials before the actual prompt appears
- **Preparation Time**: Allows standard users to obtain admin privileges via Jamf Connect or Self Service
- **Customizable**: Full control over message text, timeout, and appearance
- **Toggle Control**: Can be disabled in environments where it's not needed

This feature is particularly valuable for organizations using Jamf Connect or Self Service for temporary admin privilege escalation.

---

## Testing Features

The script includes several features to simplify testing and QA workflows:

### Test Mode

When `TEST_MODE=true`:
- Dialog displays "TEST MODE" indicator in title
- Deferral periods are shortened to 5 minutes instead of 24 hours
- Dialog shows "Defer 5 Minutes (TEST MODE)" instead of "Defer 24 Hours"
- Abort defer periods are shortened for faster testing

### OS Version Check Bypass

When `SKIP_OS_VERSION_CHECK=true`:
- Script proceeds with upgrade workflow even if system is already at the target OS version
- Provides detailed OS version comparison logs with "what would happen" messages
- Can be enabled via command line with `--test-os-check` parameter

These testing features allow you to test the complete workflow without waiting for long deferral periods or having to downgrade test systems.

## Usage

1. Deploy all three policies to your Jamf environment **in this order**:
    - **Deploy Wrapper Script** (Policy #1): Deploys script to persistent location on Mac
    - **Installer Caching** (Policy #2): Fetches the macOS installer in the background
    - **Wrapper Execution** (Policy #3): Manages prompts, deferrals, aborts, and scheduling
2. Customize dialog text, deferral limits, and abort settings at the top of the script (before deployment)
3. Configure the pre-authentication notice based on your environment needs
4. Implement duplicate prevention using Extension Attribute and Smart Group (see above)
5. Test using `TEST_MODE=true` and `SKIP_OS_VERSION_CHECK=true` for quick testing
6. Run with `--test-os-check` parameter for one-time test mode activation
7. Monitor logs and user deferral/abort history via the preference plist

---

## User Experience Flow

1. **Initial Prompt**: User is presented with three options:
   - Install Now: Proceeds immediately to installation
   - Schedule Today: Lets user select a time later today for installation
   - Defer 24 Hours: Postpones the installation (up to max deferrals)

2. **Pre-Authentication Notice**: Before credentials are requested, users see a dialog explaining they'll need admin access.

3. **Scheduled Installation with Abort**: When scheduled time arrives, users see:
   - Continue button to proceed with installation
   - Abort (Emergency) button to postpone installation (up to max aborts)

4. **Admin Authentication**: Graham's erase-install script requests admin credentials.

5. **Installation Process**: The macOS upgrade proceeds with user-facing progress indicators.

6. **Counter Management**: After successful installation, both deferral and abort counts reset to 0.
