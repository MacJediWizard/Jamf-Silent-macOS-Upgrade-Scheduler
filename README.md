# Jamf Silent macOS Upgrade Scheduler

A silent macOS upgrade orchestration wrapper for [Graham Pugh's erase-install](https://github.com/grahampugh/erase-install),  
designed for enterprise environments using Jamf Pro or other MDMs.

This script silently pre-caches macOS installers and prompts users only at the final decision point, balancing user flexibility with enforced upgrade deadlines.  
Now with **automatic dependency installation**, **test mode features**, **pre-authentication notice**, **snooze functionality**, **login-time installation**, and **comprehensive diagnostics**.

## Jamf Deployment Model

To provide a smooth upgrade experience with minimal disruption, this tool is designed to work with **two separate Jamf policies**:

### 1. Installer Caching Policy

Run this policy ahead of time to silently download and cache the macOS installer. This ensures that the upgrade can begin immediately when triggered later by the wrapper, without the delay of downloading.

**Jamf policy script:**

```bash
sudo /Library/Management/erase-install/erase-install.sh \
  --download \
  --os=15 \
  --no-fs \
  --check-power \
  --min-drive-space=50 \
  --overwrite \
  --silent
```

This policy should be scheduled to run during business hours or off-peak times, ensuring that the installer is already cached locally when needed.

### 2. Wrapper Execution Policy

The second policy runs this wrapper script. It handles:

- Prompting the user via SwiftDialog
- Displaying pre-authentication notice for standard users
- Tracking deferrals and enforcing upgrade deadlines
- Scheduling installations for later in the day or next login
- Initiating immediate upgrades if required

This script is fully self-contained and **remains available offline** after deployment, allowing it to be triggered by LaunchDaemons, login hooks, or local schedules without requiring Jamf network connectivity.

## Pre-Authentication Notice Feature

To improve user experience in environments where users operate with standard accounts but need temporary admin privileges for installation, version 1.5.5 introduces a pre-authentication notice:

- **User Notification**: Displays a dialog informing users they'll need admin credentials before the actual prompt appears
- **Preparation Time**: Allows standard users to obtain admin privileges via Jamf Connect or Self Service
- **Customizable**: Full control over message text, timeout, and appearance
- **Toggle Control**: Can be disabled in environments where it's not needed

This feature is particularly valuable for organizations using Jamf Connect or Self Service for temporary admin privilege escalation.

---

## Testing Features

The script includes several features to simplify testing and QA workflows:

### Test Mode

When `TEST_MODE=true`:
- Dialog displays "TEST MODE" indicator in title
- Deferral periods are shortened to 5 minutes instead of 24 hours
- Dialog shows "Defer 5 Minutes (TEST MODE)" instead of "Defer 24 Hours"

### OS Version Check Bypass

When `SKIP_OS_VERSION_CHECK=true`:
- Script proceeds with upgrade workflow even if system is already at the target OS version
- Provides detailed OS version comparison logs with "what would happen" messages
- Can be enabled via command line with `--test-os-check` parameter

These testing features allow you to test the complete workflow without waiting for long deferral periods or having to downgrade test systems.

## Recent Updates (v1.5.5)

- 🔐 Added pre-authentication notice dialog before admin credentials prompt
- 🛡️ Enhanced user experience for standard users in Jamf Connect environments
- ⚙️ Added configuration option to enable/disable the notice dialog
- 📝 Added customizable messaging to guide users on obtaining admin rights
- 🖼️ Implemented notice in both direct execution and scheduled installation workflows

---

## Usage

1. Deploy both policies to your Jamf environment:
    - **Installer Caching**: fetches the installer in the background
    - **Wrapper Execution**: manages prompts, deferrals, and scheduling
2. Customize dialog text and deferral limits at the top of the script
3. Configure the pre-authentication notice based on your environment needs
4. Test using `TEST_MODE=true` and `SKIP_OS_VERSION_CHECK=true` for quick testing
5. Run with `--test-os-check` parameter for one-time test mode activation
6. Monitor logs and user deferral history via the preference plist

---

## User Experience Flow

1. **Initial Prompt**: User is presented with three options:
   - Install Now: Proceeds immediately to installation
   - Schedule Today: Lets user select a time later today for installation
   - Defer 24 Hours: Postpones the installation (up to max deferrals)

2. **Pre-Authentication Notice**: Before credentials are requested, users see a dialog explaining they'll need admin access.

3. **Admin Authentication**: Graham's erase-install script requests admin credentials.

4. **Installation Process**: The macOS upgrade proceeds with user-facing progress indicators.

5. **Scheduled Installation**: If scheduled, the system will display both the pre-authentication notice and a countdown dialog at the scheduled time.
